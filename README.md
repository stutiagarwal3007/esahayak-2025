## ✨ Features

### Buyers (Leads)
- Capture buyer details with **Zod-based validation** (client + server).  
- Enums for `city`, `propertyType`, `bhk`, `purpose`, `timeline`, `source`, `status`.  
- Ownership: users can only **edit/delete their own** buyers (`ownerId`).  
- Buyer history table tracks last 5 changes (field, old → new, timestamp, user).  

### Pages & Flows
#### ➕ Create Lead – `/buyers/new`
- Form with validation: name, phone, city, propertyType, etc.  
- Conditional field: `bhk` required only for Apartment/Villa.  
- On submit → creates record + `buyer_history` entry.  

#### 📋 List & Search – `/buyers`
- Server-side pagination (10/page).  
- Filters synced to URL (`city`, `propertyType`, `status`, `timeline`).  
- Debounced search (`fullName|phone|email`).  
- Sort by `updatedAt` desc.  
- Row actions: **View / Edit**.  

#### 👀 View & Edit – `/buyers/[id]`
- Edit form with same validation rules.  
- Optimistic concurrency check using `updatedAt`.  
- Shows last 5 history entries.  

#### 📂 CSV Import/Export
- Row-level validation (show errors in table).  
- Transactional insert of valid rows only.  
- Export applies current filters/search/sort.

## 🔑 Auth & Ownership
- Supabase Auth (magic link or demo login).  
- Any logged-in user can **read all buyers**.  
- Users can **edit/delete only their own** (`ownerId`).  

---

## 🛡️ Validation & Safety
- Zod validation both client & server.  
- Budget validation: `budgetMax ≥ budgetMin`.  
- Conditional validation: `bhk` required for Apartment/Villa.  
- Rate limiting on create/update (simple per-user/IP).  
- Ownership enforcement at API layer.  

---

## 🗄️ Database
- Supabase provides Postgres.  
- Run migrations (via SQL or Supabase migration tool).  

**Schema includes:**  
- `buyers`  
- `buyer_history`  
- `users` (handled by Supabase Auth)  

---

## 📝 Design Notes
- Validation lives in a shared `schemas/` folder (Zod) → reused on client + server.  
- SSR for listing with filters/search/sort handled server-side.  
- Ownership checks enforced in Supabase policies.  
- Buyer history maintained by triggers or app logic.
